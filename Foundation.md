## 🎯 Purpose  
The goal of an ethical hacker is to improve system security by identifying and addressing vulnerabilities that could be exploited by malicious actors. It’s all about making systems more **robust and resilient**.  

---

## 🧭 Methodology  
Ethical hackers perform security tests based on how real hackers might work. They use:  
- Formal and methodical testing techniques  
- White hat hacking practices  
- Vulnerability assessments  

By doing so, they help organizations **strengthen their defenses**.

## 🛠️ Skills Required  
Proficiency in programming languages is essential for ethical hackers. For example:  
- **C** → the backbone of Linux and Unix  
- **Python, JavaScript, Bash** → for scripting and automation  
- **Networking & Operating Systems** → to understand system-level vulnerabilities  
- **Security Tools** → like Nmap, Wireshark, Metasploit
