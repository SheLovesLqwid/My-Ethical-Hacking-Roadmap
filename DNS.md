# 🌐 DNS (Domain Name System)

## 📖 Explanation
DNS (Domain Name System) is a **hierarchical and decentralized naming system** for devices connected to the internet or a private network.  

It translates **human-readable domain names** (like `www.example.com`) into **IP addresses** (like `93.184.216.34`), which computers use to identify each other on the network.  

This process is crucial for the functionality of the internet, as it allows users to access websites using **easy-to-remember names** instead of numerical IP addresses.

### 🗂️ DNS Records  
**Explanation:**  
DNS records are database records used to map a URL to an IP address. Each record type serves a specific purpose, enabling different functionalities within the DNS system.  

**Types of DNS Records:**  
- **A Record** → Maps a domain to an IPv4 address.  
- **AAAA Record** → Maps a domain to an IPv6 address.  
- **CNAME Record** → Canonical name record that aliases one domain name to another.  
- **MX Record** → Mail exchange record that directs email to a mail server.  
- **TXT Record** → Allows administrators to insert arbitrary text into a DNS record.  

**Example:**  
- The DNS **A record** for `www.example.com` might point to the IP address `93.184.216.34`.

### 🚨 DNS Attacks  
**Explanation:**  
DNS attacks exploit vulnerabilities in the DNS protocol to **redirect or intercept traffic**. These attacks can lead to **unauthorized access, data breaches, and disruption of services**.  

**Common Types of DNS Attacks:**  
- **DNS Spoofing (Cache Poisoning)** → Attackers corrupt the DNS cache, causing DNS queries to return incorrect results.  
- **DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service)** → Attackers flood a DNS server with traffic, overwhelming it and causing legitimate requests to fail.  
- **DNS Tunneling** → Attackers use DNS queries and responses to transmit data, often for malicious purposes like exfiltrating data from a network.  

**Example:**  
- In a **DNS spoofing attack**, an attacker might redirect traffic intended for `www.bank.com` to a malicious website that looks identical to the legitimate one, tricking users into entering their sensitive information.
