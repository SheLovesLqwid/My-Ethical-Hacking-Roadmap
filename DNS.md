# DNS (Domain Name System)

## Explanation

DNS (Domain Name System) is a hierarchical and decentralized naming system for devices connected to the internet or a private network. It translates human-readable domain names (like www.example.com) into IP addresses (like 93.184.216.34), which computers use to identify each other on the network. This process is crucial for the functionality of the internet, as it allows users to access websites using easy-to-remember names instead of numerical IP addresses.

### DNS Records

**Explanation:**

DNS records are database records used to map a URL to an IP address. Each record type serves a specific purpose, enabling different functionalities within the DNS system.

**Types of DNS Records:**
- A Record: Maps a domain to an IPv4 address.
- AAAA Record: Maps a domain to an IPv6 address.
- CNAME Record: Canonical name record that aliases one domain name to another.
- MX Record: Mail exchange record that directs email to a mail server.
- TXT Record: Allows administrators to insert arbitrary text into a DNS record.

**Example:**
- The DNS A record for www.example.com might point to the IP address 93.184.216.34.

### DNS Attacks

**Explanation:**

DNS attacks exploit vulnerabilities in the DNS protocol to redirect or intercept traffic. These attacks can lead to unauthorized access, data breaches, and disruption of services.

**Common Types of DNS Attacks:**
- DNS Spoofing (Cache Poisoning): Attackers corrupt the DNS cache, causing DNS queries to return incorrect results.
- DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service): Attackers flood a DNS server with traffic, overwhelming it and causing legitimate requests to fail.
- DNS Tunneling: Attackers use DNS queries and responses to transmit data, often for malicious purposes like exfiltrating data from a network.

**Example:**
- In a DNS spoofing attack, an attacker might redirect traffic intended for www.bank.com to a malicious website that looks identical to the legitimate one, tricking users into entering their sensitive information.
